Content is maintained in markdown with the ability of composing output pages from multiple markdown fragments.\n\nThe following use-cases are supported:\n\n- Command-line tool for generating static websites\n- Web server for previewing generated HTML locally\n- Web server deployed on a PaaS like Heroku\n\nThe generator+editor can also run in-browser, allowing non-technical users to edit and instantly preview the generated HTML, without first installing pub-server themselves.\n\nBy using markdown text fragments for managing content we are able to simplify the stack (no database to install) as well as provide users with all the benefits of modern tools like github for versioning and collaboration.\n\nThere is no need to compromise on site or page structure just because user content lives in \"style-free\" markdown -- with templates and a little bit of plugin code, any information design and HTML/CSS layout can be supported.\n\npub-server generates finished HTML by combining markdown fragments with clean and fully-extensible handlebars templates. This provides maximal decoupling of user content from developer code and designer presentation.\n\nThe generated output uses npm-installable themes and is fully customizable.\n\nLet's try to make it fun again to build nice clean front-end designs that others can enjoy!\n"},{"path":"/010 How it works.md","text":"# How it works\n\n### tl;dr\nAll text-content lives in **markdown** fragments inside **text** files in one or more **sources**. Fragments in the same file are separated by a delimiter like\n\n    ---- /page-1 ----\n\n**pub-generator** compiles markdown fragments into javascript objects which are rendered to HTML by applying **handlebars templates**.\n\n\n### sources\nSources are directories in your project or inside a theme package. Source directories are scanned, and new files picked up automatically when the source is read.\n\nHandlebars templates live in files in sources just like markdown text. In fact, templates and markdown may live together in the same source file as long as each is clearly identified e.g. (simplified content)\n\n\n    ---- /page-1 ----\n\n    page1 markdown text...\n\n    ---- /main-layout.hbs ----\n\n    <html>{{{renderPage}}}</html>\n\n\n\n### pages and fragments\nThere are 2 kinds of markdown content:\n\n1. **pages** have a \"normal\" page url or href. e.g. `/pages/about-us`\n2. **fragments** have an href with a fragment #id. e.g. `/blog/2014/year-in-review#conclusions`\n\nThe href may be specified in a header at the top of the markdown like the examples above or derived from the source path: E.g. a file `/md/pages/About Us.md` may become `/pages/about-us` assuming `/md` is the source.\n\nFilenames are turned into urls by slugifying i.e. lowercasing and converting non-alphanumeric characters into hyphens.\n\nIn addition to having an href, all pages and fragments may acquire additional metadata from their markdown headers. E.g to set a title for the home page, add the following at the top of the index.md file.\n\n    ---- / ----\n    title: Introduction\n\n    **pub-server** is a lightweight content management tool for publishing on the web\n\n\n### templates and rendering\npub-server invokes compiled templates to render pages.\n\nPage or fragment objects provide the input \"context\" for handlebars. E.g. If a template contains `{{title}}`, handlebars will look for a `.title` property on the current page or fragment object and insert the value of that property into the html output.\n\nTemplate evaluation is performed in a nested manner\n\n- The outer layout template will include a helper like `{{{renderPage}}}`\n- This invokes an inner page template which may render the page markdown using `{{{html}}}` or it may iterate over page-fragments using a block helper like `{{{#eachFragment}}}...{{{/eachFragment}}}`\n\nTemplates may be explicitly specified. E.g. to use an outer template called `hero` instead of the default 'main-layout', specify `layout:hero` in the markdown header. Similarly, to use a page layout called `flow`, specify `template:flow` in the markdown header.\n\n\n### loading\nBefore rendering (or every time a source is modified) the generator does:\n\n- *read* text files in order from all (or just the modified) sources\n- *pre-process* each file into one or more fragments\n- *compile* .md fragments into arrays of javascript objects\n- *compile* .hbs fragments into handlebars templates\n- *emit* events which can trigger additional processing by plugins\n\nPage-fragments are automatically attached to pages during compilation. This makes it easy for templates to iterate over the fragments in a page during rendering.\n"},{"path":"/011 Installation.md","text":"# Installation\n\n### System requirements\n\npub-server was developed with node.js or io.js on Mac OSX, so that is the recommended environment to run locally (for now).\n\nA 1-click installer which eliminates the need to pre-install node.js and use the command-line is coming soon. Fixes for Windows support are also a high priority.\n\n\n### Global install\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g pub-server\n```\n\nAt this point you can run `pub` from the command line in any directory, to preview your `.md` files.\n\n### Project-specific install\n\nInstead of depending on a global install, you can add pub-server to your project's package.json.\nThis provides more granular control over which version of pub-server is being used.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev pub-server\n```\n\nIf you want to deploy pub-server onto a PaaS like Heroku, use a regular dependency\ninstead of a devDependency.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save pub-server\n```\n\n### Configuring scripts\n\nYou can also create script aliases for running pub with different options in your package.json E.g.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"develop\":  \"pub\",\n  \"generate\": \"pub -O\",\n  \"static\":   \"pub -S out\"\n}\n```\n\nNow you can call `npm run develop` or `npm run generate` or `npm run static`.\n\nSee [](/command-line) for details.\n"},{"path":"/012 Simple doc site.md","text":"# Creating a simple doc site\n\nThe following recipe will work in any github project repo.\nIt assumes [pub-server](https://github.com/jldec/pub-server) installed globally.\nThis new site uses [pub-theme-doc](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc)\nand a flat list of pages.

The `pub-config` for this documentation lives [here](https://github.com/jldec/pub-doc-src/blob/master/pub-config.js).\n\nA directory with a `pub-config` can also be packaged as a pub-server package or theme and distributed via npm, making it available for re-use in other projects.\n\n\n### options structure\n\n`pub-config` exports a single javascript options object. The main path options keys are listed below and each is documented on a separate page\n\n- `pkgs:` [Packages and Themes](/packages-and-themes)\n- `sources:` Paths to [Sources](/sources)\n- `outputs:` Paths to [Outputs](/outputs)\n- `staticPaths:` Paths to [Static Files](/static-files)\n- `browserScripts:` Generating [Browser Scripts](/browser-scripts)\n- `generatorPlugins:` [Generator Plugins](/generator-plugins)\n- `serverPlugins:` [Server Plugins](/server-plugins)\n\nBesides the main path options, the following core server and generator options are recognized.\n\n```js\nopts.production     // boolean (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')\nopts.port           // override port (process.env.PORT || '3001')\nopts.appUrl         // string - qualify URLs (process.env.APP)\nopts.linkNewWindow  // boolean - add target=\"_blank\" to external links\n```\n\nAdditional options may be available depending on the active theme e.g for adding links to GitHub and copyright notices.\n\n### JSON or JavaScript\n\nYou have the choice of using either a .json or .js file for configuration.\n\nIf you use a .js file, export the options object using `module.exports`. The following example shows how to generate different config options using environment variables.\n\n```js\nvar opts = module.exports = {};\n\nopts.cloud       = process.env.CLOUD;\nopts.auth        = process.env.AUTH;\n\nopts.pkgs        = ['pub-pkg-seo'];\nif (opts.auth) { opts.pkgs.push('pub-pkg-google-oauth'); }\n\nopts.sources     = [...];\nopts.staticPaths = [...];\nopts.outputs     = opts.cloud ? null : [...];\n```\n\nThe syntax for .json is stricter, and it is not possible to include conditional logic, but json is easier to manipulate and re-serialize. No explicit `export` is required for json files.\n\n##### Canonical path options format\n\nPath options (all the keys above) can be either strings or objects and single-values or arrays. Objects are required if one path has additional properties. Arrays are required when there are multiple paths. The following are equivalent.\n\n```js\nsources: './markdown'\nsources: ['./markdown']\nsources: { path:'./markdown' }\nsources: [{ path:'./markdown' }]\n```\n\n### Inspecting the config\n\nTo inspect the fully resolved options while pub-server is running, browse to `/admin/opts`.\n\n`pub -C` will present a similar result on the command line.\n"},{"path":"/014 Packages and Themes.md","text":"# Packages and Themes\n\n`pub-server` may be extended with **packages**.\n\nPackages are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) modules with their own `pub-config`.\n\n**Themes** are packages which include layout templates for building standalone websites. Most projects either include just one theme or they define their own layout. The theme for this documentation is [pub-theme-doc](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc).\n\n## Consuming packages\n\nPackages are consumed by pub-server projects, by including their names (or paths) in the `pkgs` key.\n\n```js\n  pkgs: [\n    'pub-theme-doc',\n    'pub-pkg-prism',\n    'pub-pkg-font-awesome',\n    'pub-pkg-seo'\n  ],\n```\n\nFor extra parameters, use `{ path:\"name\", ... }` instead of name strings like the example above.  \n\nTo use packages which are not included with `pub-server`, they first have to be installed.\n\n```\nnpm install --save <pkg-name>\n```\n\nThis will add a reference to the latest released version of the package into the `dependencies` list of your `package.json`.\n\n\n#### Resolving paths\n\nWhen you run `pub` from the command line, it looks for a `pub-config` file and invokes the [pub-resolve-opts](https://github.com/jldec/pub-resolve-opts) module.\n\nThis module resolves all paths relative to your project directory or, in the case of packages, relative to each package directory. It also merges the lists of paths from inside any included packages, making everything inside the package available to the parent project.\n\nThis mechanism allows pub-server packages to introduce their own `staticPaths`, `sources` etc. for re-use in your project.\n\n\n## package nesting\n\npub-server packages may not recursively contain other pub-server packages. Any nested inner packages listed in a package-level `pub-config` will be ignored when the top-level package is consumed.\n\nThis limitation is intentional, because current web standards like HTML and CSS are not recursively composable. For example, since all CSS classes share one namespace, the CSS classes inside a nested package will leak out into the global namespace.\n\nOf course pub-server packages may include (recursively) 3rd party npm modules as dependencies inside their own `package.json`.\n"},{"path":"/015 Sources.md","text":"# Sources\n\n`pub-server` uses content stored in sources to generate your site.\n\nMost sources are directories in your project or inside a theme package. Source directories are scanned, and new files picked up automatically when the source is read.\n\nFile-system sources can be watched and automatically re-read when changes are detected.\n\n## Source modules\n\nIn addition to the default file-system sources, pub-server supports pluggable npm modules which can read and write files from github, dropbox etc.\n\nThese are configured configuring `source.src` with the source module name E.g. 'pub-src-github'.\n\nThe source API is able to glob directories recursively, and return an ordered set of files, optionally matching a glob pattern.\n\nFor more information see [pub-src-fs](https://github.com/jldec/pub-src-fs) and\n[pub-src-github](https://github.com/jldec/pub-src-github)\n\n[pub-src-redis](https://github.com/jldec/pub-src-redis) can also serve as a cache for other sources.\n\nSource modules are resolved and loaded by pub-resolve-opts at startup time.\n\n## Markdown fragments\n\npub-server content is maintained in markdown fragments inside files which originate in sources.\n\nFragments in the same file are separated by a delimiter like\n\n    ---- /page-1 ----\n\nFor an overview of why we use fragments see the blog post [pub-server Fragments](https://blog.pubblz.com/pub-server-fragments).\n\n\n## Handlebars templates\n\nHandlebars templates are also just files (or fragments) in sources. For templates, pub-server looks an `.hbs` extension.\n\nTemplates are the key to separating HTML from content stored in markdown, making the content maintainable by non-developers.\n\npub-server compiles and invokes specific templates when it generates each page in a site. The templates use built-in [](/helpers) to call javascript functions for things like page-variable interpolation and markdown rendering. Custom helpers can be defined using [](generator-plugins).\n\n\n### Sample config\n\nThe sample below is used in a complex environment to run locally and on a Heroku server for staging. The hosted server uses a redis cache and pulls sources from GitHub.\n\n```js\nvar ifLocal = opts.localhost;\nvar ghTest  = process.env.TEST_GH;\n\nopts.sources = [\n\n  { name:           'markdown',\n    src:            (ifLocal && !ghTest) ? 'pub-src-fs' :    'pub-src-github',\n    path:           (ifLocal && !ghTest) ? '../<repo>/md'  : '/md',\n    repo:           '...',     // for pub-src-github\n    glob:           '**/*.md',\n    depth:          4,\n    cache:          (ifLocal ? null : 'pub-src-redis'),\n    leftDelim:      '----',\n    rightDelim:     '',\n    headerDelim:    '----',\n    slugify:        {allow:'_'},\n    writable:       true,\n    fragmentDelim:  true },\n\n  { name:           'templates',\n    path:           './templates',\n    compile:        'handlebars',\n    cache:          ifLocal ? null : 'pub-src-redis' },\n\n  { name:           'schedule',\n    path:           '...',\n    src:            'pub-src-http',\n    cache:          (ifLocal ? null : 'pub-src-redis'),\n    interval:       '20m',\n    timeout:        '10s',\n    type:           'JSON',\n    log:            true }\n];\n```\n\n#### notes:\n- `source.writable` is required for the editor to save files back to the source.\n- `source.name` enables use of `generator.sourcePage$[name]` in helpers.\n- `leftDelim`, `rightDelim`, `headerDelim` customizes fragment header syntax.\n- setting `source.compile` to 'handlebars'` forces all fragments to be treated as handlebars templates, irrespective of extensions.\n- setting `source.type` to something other than 'FILE' causes the source to be treated as an opaque JSON object instead of an array containing file objects.\n"},{"path":"/016 Outputs.md","text":"# Outputs\n\n`pub -O` generates a complete site including .html files generated from markdown, [](browser-scripts), and copies of [](static-files).\n\nThe output destination defaults to `./out`\n\nUsually `pub-config` will contain a single `outputs` configuration with the path and any other output-specific settings.\n\n```js\noutputs: {\n  path: './tgt',\n  relPaths: true,\n  omitRoutes: ['/img'],\n  fqImages: { route:'/img', url:'https://techxlab.github.io' }\n},\n```\n\n`path` overrides the default output destination directory\n\n`relPaths` converts all internal URLs to relative paths. This is very helpful if you want to open the generated HTML files by opening them in a browser directly from the file system.\n\n`omitRoutes` can be use to omit directories which a not required in the output e.g. image directories hosted at a different CDN endpoint.\n\n`fqImages` specifies a route pattern for URLs which will be rewritten e.g. to point to a different host or CDN endpoint.\n"},{"path":"/017 Static Files.md","text":"# Static files\n\n### Serving static files with pub-server\n\nWhen pub-server is running it will serve static files according to `opts.staticPaths` in `pub-config`.\n\n```js\nopts.staticPaths = [\n{ path:   './img',\n  route:  '/images',\n  depth:  3,\n  glob:   '**/*.{jpg,gif,png}' },\n\n{ path:   './static',\n  glob:   '**/*.{css,js}' } ];\n\nopts.injectCss: [ '/css/stylesheet1.css', '/css/stylessheet2.css' ],\nopts.injectJs: [ '/js/library1.js', '/js/library2.js' ],\n```\n\nThis config will serve images located up to 3 levels under `./img` when browsers request urls starting with `/images/...`.\n\nThe config will also serve all `.js` and `.css` files located in '/static/js' and '/static/css', and explicitly inject 2 of each into the HTML using `opts.injectCss` and `opts.injectJs`.\n\nThe `.glob` [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern is used to test every file for matches.\n\nThe server ignores directories and files starting with `.` and `node_modules` unless they are explicitly served as single files (see below).\n\nStatic directories may exist inside [packages](/packages-and-themes) like the [default doc theme](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc) and [pub-pkg-editor](https://github.com/jldec/pub-pkg-editor). This explains how [jQuery](https://github.com/jldec/pub-pkg-jquery) and other files are made available when you run `pub` on the command line.\n\nHINT: To see which directories are being served, you can turn on console debug output just for statics by setting `DEBUG='pub:static'`. For a JSON list of all static files, query the server at `http://localhost:3001/admin/statics`.\n\nIf there is no `pub-config`,  pub-server will also serve static files from the first level of the current directory, or you can point to a directory containing static files with the command line `pub -s <dir>`. (note lower-case `s`)\n\n\n### Static directory scan\n\nUnlike [express](https://expressjs.com/) which reads the file system on each request, pub-server serves static files by scanning static paths on startup, and subsequently serving only those paths which were found in the scan. A watcher can be configured to trigger a re-scan of the path when new files arrive.\n\nThis allows pub-server to \"mount\" many static paths for all the included [packages](/packages-and-themes), and to serve single files (like favicons) mounted on root, without stat'ing the file system on each path for each request\n\nFor more details see [`server/serve-statics.js`](https://github.com/jldec/pub-server/blob/master/server/serve-statics.js).\n\n\n### Serving single files and injecting CSS or JS\nA `staticPaths` entry can point either to a directory or to a single file.\n\nThe following will include all files under `./static` as well as 2 `dot` files necessary for GitHub Pages.\n\n```js\nstaticPaths: [ './static', '.gitignore', '.nojekyll' ]\n```\n\nAdding `inject:true` on single file paths will inject a CSS `<link>` or JS `<script>` as in this example from [pub-theme-brief](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-brief).\n\nstaticPaths: [\n  {path:'./css/brief.css', route:'/css', inject:true },\n  {path:'./js/brief.js', route:'/js', inject:true }\n]\n\n### Publishing static files\n\n`pub -O` will copy static files from all `staticPaths` to the output destination when a website is generated.\n\nThis behavior uses the same configuration with `depth` and `glob` patterns to prevent unnecessary files from being copied.\n\n### Static-only mode\n\n`pub -S <dir>` runs `pub-server` in static-only mode, serving ONLY static files from any directory. It mimics the behavior of GitHub Pages, looking for index.html files in folders, and redirecting from /folder-name to /folder-name/\n\nThis is especially useful for testing static HTML containing relative links. E.g. if `./out` holds your generated site and you do `pub -S .` you can navigate to `http://localhost:3001/out/` to test the site as if it were hosted in a subdirectory on the server.\n\nSee [](links) for details about configuring pub-server to generate relative links.\n"},{"path":"/018 Browser Scripts.md","text":"# Browser Scripts\n\nIn addition to generating HTML from markdown, `pub-server` can bundle browser scripts using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).\n\nThis makes it easy to serve front-end scripts which `require()` npm modules just like node.js server-side code.\n\nBrowser scripts are served live, and also saved to output when a site is generated.\n\nNOTE: Scripts that do not include other modules or don't require any transformation, are easier to serve as [](static-files).\n"},{"path":"/019 Generator Plugins.md","text":"# Generator Plugins\n\nMany pub-server packages rely on generator plugins, usually to provide specialized handlebars helpers.\n\nGenerator plugins are \"universal\" npm modules. They run in node.js, as well as in browsers.\n\nHere is the `pub-config` entry from [pub-theme-doc](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc).\n\n```js\ngeneratorPlugins: './plugins/generator-plugin.js',\n```\n\nThe file path follows the node.js `require(path)` convention of using relative paths for modules which are local files and bare names for installable npm modules.\n\nHere is the [plugin](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc/blob/master/plugins/generator-plugin.js):\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(generator) {\n\n  var u = generator.util;\n  var opts = generator.opts;\n  var hb = generator.handlebars;\n\n  hb.registerHelper('navIcon', function(frame) {\n\n    return hb.defaultFragmentHtml('/#navicon',\n      '_!bars fw lg_',\n      '<span class=\"icon\">=</span>',\n      frame);\n  });\n\n  hb.registerHelper('docTitle', function(frame) {\n    var title = opts.docTitle || opts.pkgName || 'pub-server';\n    var subTitle = opts.docSubTitle || '';\n\n    return hb.defaultFragmentHtml('/#doctitle',\n      '# [' + title + '](/)\\n' + subTitle,\n      '<h1><a href=\"/\">' + u.escape(title) + '</a></h1>' + subTitle,\n      frame);\n  });\n\n  hb.registerHelper('topMenu', function(frame) {\n    var url = opts.github || hb.githubUrl();\n\n    return hb.defaultFragmentHtml('/#topmenu',\n      url ?

'<ul><li><a href=\"' + url + '\">github</a></li></ul>' : '',\n      frame);\n  });\n\n}\n```\n\nGenerator plugins are expected to export a single function which is called once at startup. The function is passed a single `generator` parameter which is an instance of `pub-generator`.\n\n### Registering helpers\n\nPlugins can register new helpers using the handlebars instance at `generator.handlebars`.\n\nAn interesting example is the generator plugin in [pub-pkg-font-awesome](https://github.com/jldec/pub-pkg-font-awesome) which, besides registering some helpers, also replaces a small part of `generator.renderer` to extend the markdown syntax for emphasis/italics.\n\n### Manipulating the generator page model\n\nPlugins which need to manipulate the page content model after it has been loaded from source, can do so by hooking into a 'pages-ready' event emitted by the generator after loading source files and parsing all the markdown and templates\n\n```js\ngenerator.on('pages-ready', function() {\n    decoratePages();\n  });\n```\n\nNote that the `pages-ready` event will be triggered each time the server reloads sources e.g. when watching directories for changes.\n"},{"path":"/020 Server Plugins.md","text":"# Server Plugins\n\nServer Plugins are npm modules which extend pub-server's built-in [web server](web-server-configuration). A working example is [pub-pkg-google-oauth](https://github.com/jldec/pub-pkg-google-oauth).\n\nServer plugins export a single function which receives an instance of the pubServer object. This function is called once at startup, providing a hook for the plugin to add routes etc.\n\nFor additional control over the sequencing of when routes are added, the server emits `init-app-first` before mounting pages, statics, and browser scripts and it emits `init-app-last` after those are mounted.\n\nServer plugins are configured in pub-config\n\n```js\nopts.serverPlugins = [ './my-server-plugin' ];\n```\n\n## The pubServer object\n\n```js\n{\n  opts:          // global opts object (including opts.log)\n  app:           // express app\n  generator:     // pub-generator\n}\n```\n\n`pubServer` is an eventEmitter.\n"},{"path":"/021 Web Server Configuration.md","text":"# Web Server Configuration\n\n`pub-server` can be deployed as a node.js Web server with built-in support for:\n\n- Error handling and redirects\n- Cookie sessions\n- User request logging to session memory or redis\n- System event logging to redis\n- Access control lists and plugin-support for OAuth\n- Static and generated files\n- File-system watchers\n- Websockets\n\nThe server is based on [express](https://expressjs.com/).\n\n## Error handling\n\n`pub-server` mounts a 404 'not-found' and a 500 'server-error' handler.\n\nThe 404 logic will be triggered if no pages, staticPaths, or browserScripts match the requested path. It returns an empty 404 status for requests with a non-html extension.\n\nNot-found requests for paths with no extension, or with an html extension will be 302 redirected to the home page or the first page found, unless there is an explicit /404 page in the content. This results in a much better experience for `pub` when it is used to render say a directory containing just a single README.md\n\nServer errors will result in a simple empty 500 status response unless there is an explicit /500 page in the content.\n\n## Sessions\n\nSessions are automatically enabled. Please refer to  [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) for configuration details.\n\nSession options may be maintained in `opts.session` in `pub-config` E.g.\n\n```js\nopts.session =\n{ cookie:            { secure: opts.production, maxAge: 60*60*1000 },\n  saveUninitialized: true,\n  rolling:           false,\n  saveOldSessions:   true };\n```\n\nSession storage with with redis is enabled by setting `opts.redis` in `pub-config` and, if necessary, configuring the redis credentials via environment variables.\n\n```\nhost: process.env.RCH // 'localhost'\nport: process.env.RCP // 6379\nauth: process.env.RCA // ''\n```\n\n## System logs\n\nModules in pub-server call a global 'opts.log(...)' provided by [logger-emitter](https://github.com/jldec/logger-emitter) to show warnings and errors on the console.\n\nIf you set `opts.redis._log = <key-name>`, the same events will be timestamped and logged into a [redis list](https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro).\n\n## Session logs\n\npub-server can record clicks and other events generated in the browser via the `/server/log/<path>?<params>` api.\n\nHTTP requests sent to this endpoint will stored as objects containing the request path and parameters in the `session.log` and, if redis is enabled, automatically persisted with the session. E.g. a client with jQuery may use the following.\n\n```\n(function logReqeust() {\n  $.getJSON('/server/log' + location.pathname + (location.search || ''));\n}());\n```\n\nThe default `/server/log` route can be configured by setting 'opts.session.logRequestPath'.\n"},{"path":"/025 The Page Model.md","text":"# The Page Model\n\nAs mentioned in [](/how-it-works), markdown fragments in source files are parsed into javascript page and fragment objects when the generator is loaded.\n\nThe representation in memory is very simple.\n\n`generator.pages` is a flat array of all `page` objects in source order.\n\nEach `page` object has:\n\n    _txt:       the unparsed page body text (usually markdown)\n    _hdr:       the unparsed page header\n    _fragments: a flat array of page fragments for rendering in order\n    _href:      the url path for the page\n    _file:      a reference to a source file object for saving edits\n    _parent:    the parent page in the page url hierarchy\n    _children:  an array of child pages in the page url hierarchy\n    _next:      the next sibling page in the url hierarchy\n    _prev:      the previous sibling page in the url hierarchy\n    #*:         #named fragments for rendering fragments by name\n    *:          named values parsed from the page header\n\nThis basic structure, which is derived from a very simple text file format, is sufficient to represent complex pages with lots of fragments, as well as complex hierarchical sites with lots of pages.\n\nAnd, by breaking pages into fragments, standard markdown can be used inside fragments, without requiring additional markdown extensions to represent arbitrary layout elements like columns and sections.\n\n[](/generator-plugins) for themes or custom sites may manipulate page objects, creating additional properties for alternative content hierarchies or to classify various types of pages.\n\nPlugins can also use the page structure to generate menus, sitemaps, and other navigation.\n"},{"path":"/027 Links.md","text":"# Links\n\nFor content maintained in markdown, it is important not to have to worry about where that content is going to be hosted, or even which level of the site the content will live on, relative to other pages on the site.\n\nFor this reason all links inside the markdown should use a simple \"rooted path\" convention both for specifying the urls of pages, and for referencing other pages via links inside the markdown. Rooted paths start with '/' for the index page, and continue in a typical hierarchy below that. E.g.\n\n```\n/products/vendor-name/product-name\n```\n\n## Generating static HTML with links\n\nGenerating links for static HTML pages can be challenging, especially if the site is being hosted in a subdirectory on the server or if image links need to be rewritten to use a separate CDN endpoint.\n\nE.g Content inside page1 may refer to page2 using a path like `/path/to/page2` but this will break if the running site lives at a url like `https://me.github.io/website-root/`\n\nThere are two approaches to solving this - both are automatable but ugly.\n\n1. auto-prefix links with a root path like `/website-root/path/to/page2`\n2. auto-prefix links with relative paths like '../../path/to/page2'\n\nThe current version of pub-server supports the 2nd approach to auto-prefix links originating in markdown with the correct relative paths. In `pub-config` this is configured per-output as follows:\n\n```js\noutputs: {\n  path: './out',   // configure output directory\n  relPaths: true   // auto-prefix links with relative paths\n}\n```\n\nE.g if a markdown page `/posts/year/month/day.html` includes an image at `/static/images/me.jpg`, the generated img src will point to `../../../static/images/me.jpg`.\n\nOne benefit of using this approach is that the resulting tree of static html files can be hosted at any level. No prior knowledge of the destination directory name is required when the site is generated. This can be helpful for testing or cloning sites.\n\n\n## Links to directories and trailing /\n\nUnlike a file system, it is quite normal to have pages on a website with URLs which look like links to directories in the URL hierarchy. E.g. `/products/vendor-name/` may return a page about the vendor, and then each child page in the hierarchy could be a product from that vendor.\n\nThis raises the question of whether or not to include the trailing `/` in the URL at the directory level, and what to return when users browse to a URL without the `/`.\n\n> Github Pages will automatically 301-redirect from the URL without the trailing '/' to the URL with the trailing '/' if there is a directory with that name, and it has an index.html file.\n\nThis means that if you are targeting Github Pages and you have directories in your site hierarchy, use the trailing '/' for naming those pages and for links pointing to those pages to avoid sending users to pages with redirects.\n\nPages which are NOT directories generally don't have a trailing '/'.\n\nIf you prefer you can even omit the trailing '/' on URLs which are directories. When pub-server generates static HTML output files, it will automatically figure out when to generate directories containing an index.html file, and when it can simply use a file called `<directory-name>.html` for the page.\n\n_NOTE: Using the trailing '/' also affects the way browsers interpret relative links, since they effectively add another level to the hierarchy. E.g. a link like './pagename' will mean something different if it occurs inside the HTML of a page at '/directory' vs. a page at '/directory/'.  When pub-server is generating output with `relPaths`, it will figure out the right level for either case._\n\n## Links in templates\n\nTemplates may include links to CSS stylesheets etc. For these to receive the same treatment as links in markdown the `{{relPath}}` helper should be used in front of the link e.g.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"{{relPath}}/img/favicon.ico\" type=\"image/x-icon\">\n```\n\nIf the output has been configured with `relPaths:true`, this `{{relPath}}` helper will insert a './' or the correct number of levels of `../../` etc.\n\n## Publishing with links to files/images on another server\n\nA site may have links to assets in the local filesystem during development, but those links are then converted to fully qualified links on a different server when the site is published.\n\nThis may be configured using output configuration settings as follows.\n\n```js\noutputs: {\n  path: './out',\n  relPaths: true,\n\n  // don't copy assets under /assets to /out\n  omitRoutes: ['/assets'],\n\n  // prefix /assets... with the specified url\n  fqImages: { route:'/assets', url:'https://assets.example.com' }\n}\n```\n\nThese settings will auto-prefix any markdown links matching `fqImages.route` with the specified `fqImages.url` during conversion from markdown to HTML.\n\nThe same is made possible for links inside templates by wrapping the hardwired local paths with a `{{fixPath <path>}}` helper.\n\nE.g.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"{{fixPath '/assets/document-abc.pdf'}}\">Download</a>\n```\n"},{"path":"/030 Command line.md","text":"# Command Line Options\n\n#### Usage: `pub [options] [dir]`\nSpecifying dir will direct pub to a different working directory.\n\n##### `-h, --help`\nOutput usage information on the command line.\n\n##### `-p, --port {port}`\nOverride the default server port [3001].\n\n##### `-t, --theme {name}`\nOverride the default theme with different module-name or dir, repeatable.\n\n##### `-o, --output-path {dir}`\nOverride the default output directory [.].\n\n##### `-O, --output-only`\nGenerate a set of output html together with static files into the output directory, and exit.\n\n##### `-G, --html-only`\nOutput only generated html files and exit.\n\n##### `-r, --root <prefix>`\nPrefix urls with a static root, \".\" means path relative.\n\n##### `-s, --static {dir}`\nOverride default static directory [.].\nAlso supports {dir},{route}.

This discussion assumes that you are publishing on GitHub Pages by pushing a \"Project\" repo with a `gh-pages` branch as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).\n\n## Recommended approach: _separate repo_\n\nMost docs assume that you want to maintain your gh-pages with your source in one repo.\n\nHowever, things get a lot simpler if you separate the repo which holds the source used to generate your site, from the \"gh-pages\" repo used to publish it on GitHub Pages.\n\n- no switching branches and merging trees\n- no empty gh-pages orphan branch to intialize\n- no static content cluttering up your source repo\n- and allow for sites generated from multiple source projects\n\n## Publishing a new site to gh-pages\n\nThe following steps assume that you will use an `out` subdirectory in the root of the source project. Alternative paths can be configured using the `outputs` key in your pub-config.\n\nTo prevent the output files from being picked up as part of the source repo, add `/out/` to your `.gitignore` file.\n\nThe first time you run `pub -O` it will create an `out` directory for your html output and other assets.\n\nTest the output by running `pub -S .` and then navigating to [http://localhost:3001/out/](http://localhost:3001/out/).\n\nThe `-S <path>` option runs pub-server as a static-only web server, emulating GitHub Pages. If you don't use a custom domain, this will also test the relative links in your html since your site on GitHub Pages will live under `https://<id>.github.io/<repo>/...`.\n\nIf [links](/links) are broken, make sure that your pub-config has an output with `relPaths` set. e.g\n\n```js\noutputs: {\n  path: './out',\n  relPaths: true\n},\n```\n\nAt this point it may also be useful to run `git status` in the root of your main project to make sure that the `out` directory is properly ignored. If not, add '/out/' to your `.gitignore` file.\n\nWhen you are ready to publish a new GitHub Pages repo:\n\n```bash\ncd out\ngit init\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m 'first pub-server output'\ngit branch -m gh-pages\n```\n\nThe last step above just renames the default \"master\" branch to \"gh-pages\".\n\nFollow the normal process to create a new repo on Gitub and use the suggested commands for intializing that with an existing repo, _except_ when you `git push -u` the first time, replace \"master\" with \"gh-pages\".\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<id>/<repo>.git\ngit push -u origin gh-pages\n```\n\n## Publishing updates\n\nUpdating the site on GitHub Pages requires no fancy git magic. Simply re-generate the output into the `out` directory using `pub -O` and then commit and push the changes to GitHub.\n"}]},{"path":"/Users/jleschner/pub/server/node_modules/pub-theme-doc/templates","_pkg":"pub-theme-doc","name":"templates","type":"FILE","watch":false,"files":[{"path":"/default.hbs","text":"{{{html}}}\n{{#each
